# hello-world
My first attempt at using GitHub

hello world, my name is Catherine and I am attempting to create my first functional GitHub repo, so that I can begin to learn how to best use this wonderful resource.  Distributed Revision Control is at the crux of an app I would like to make, called My Twyg.  My Twyg, is a recipe app that I decided I wanted to try to make a couple months ago in May/June.  Now in September, I have some work to learn tools, such as CSS and HTML and JavaScript - and now adding Git and GitHub - to create a funcitoning, interactive web app.
